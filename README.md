SQL for Data Analysis ðŸš„

This project simulates a railway reservation system using MySQL. It demonstrates core relational database concepts such as table creation, relationships, joins, aggregate queries, subqueries, and views.

The system is modeled to simulate real-world train service operations, incorporating essential elements like customer information, ticket issuance, payment processing, seat reservations, and train service management. Each table serves a specific purpose and is interconnected to enable seamless operations, making it an excellent tool for learning and understanding the power of SQL in complex real-world scenarios.
